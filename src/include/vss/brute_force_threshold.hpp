/**
 * @brief Exact threshold (radius) join via tiled GEMM + stream compaction.
 *
 * For every query vector, emits every dataset vector whose distance under @p
 * metric is within @p eps. This is a fork of cuVS's `tiled_brute_force_knn`
 * loop: it reuses the same tiled `pairwise_distance` (GEMM) + one-time norm
 * correction, then replaces the per-tile `select_k` with a `copy_if` on the
 * threshold. Because "within eps" is independent across column tiles, no
 * cross-tile merge is needed, so the column-tile reconciliation that top-k
 * requires is simply gone.
 *
 * Memory stays tiled: only a [tile_rows x tile_cols] distance block plus the
 * ragged output (proportional to the number of surviving edges, not m*n) is
 * held. The dense [m, n] matrix is never materialized.
 *
 * @p eps is in @p metric's own distance units, matching what the tile produces:
 *   - L2SqrtExpanded / L2SqrtUnexpanded: a Euclidean radius.
 *   - CosineExpanded: a cosine-distance cutoff `1 - min_similarity` (handled
 *     natively via GEMM — no unit-normalization needed, unlike ball_cover eps_nn).
 * The keep direction follows `cuvs::distance::is_min_close(metric)`.
 *
 * Output columns are allocated through @p mr. Enqueued on @p res's stream and
 * not synchronized before returning (same contract as @ref brute_force_knn).
 *
 * @param res        Caller-owned RAFT resources; the join runs on its stream.
 * @param dataset    Row-major dataset (right) batch to search.
 * @param queries    Row-major query (left) batch.
 * @param eps        Threshold in @p metric's distance units.
 * @param metric     Distance metric.
 * @param mr         Device resource for the output columns.
 * @param tile_rows  Row tile size; 0 = pick automatically.
 * @param tile_cols  Column tile size; 0 = pick automatically.
 * @return Ragged edge list of (query_row, dataset_row, distance).
