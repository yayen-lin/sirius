/**
 * @brief Physical operator for scanning Apache Iceberg tables on the GPU.
 *
 * Inherits the parquet scan machinery (bind_data, column_ids, projection_ids, etc.)
 * from sirius_physical_parquet_scan. The iceberg-specific additions are the delete
 * file lists for V2 row-level delete support.
 *
 * For V1 Iceberg tables (append-only), positional_delete_files and
 * equality_delete_files are both empty and execution is identical to a plain
 * parquet scan. For V2 tables the iceberg_scan_task_global_state reads these
 * files and installs a post-convert hook that applies the deletes on GPU after
 * each row-group batch is decompressed.
