 * @brief Build a mapping from column_ids index to batch column position.

 * The parquet scan (make_selected_column_indices) produces batch columns in
 * column_ids order, but only for indices present in projection_ids.
 * For example, if column_ids has 5 entries and projection_ids = {1, 3}:
 *   batch position 0 → column_ids[1]
 *   batch position 1 → column_ids[3]
 *
 * When projection_ids is empty, every column_ids entry maps to its own index.
 *
 * Returns a vector of size column_ids_count where:
 *   result[i] = batch position of column_ids[i], or idx_t(-1) if not projected.
