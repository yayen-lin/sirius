  //!     - The current streaming pipeline will have a dependency on it (dependency across
  //!     MetaPipelines)
  //!     - Unions of this streaming pipeline will automatically inherit this dependency
  //! 2. Build child pipelines last (e.g., Hash Join becomes source after probe is done: scan HT for
  //! FULL OUTER JOIN)
  //!     - 'last' means after building out all other pipelines associated with this operator
  //!     - The child pipeline automatically has dependencies (within this GPUMetaPipeline) on:
  //!         * The 'current' streaming pipeline
  //!         * And all pipelines that were added to the GPUMetaPipeline after 'current'
