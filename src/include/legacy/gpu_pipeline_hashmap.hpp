/**
 * @brief Helper container that indexes GPU pipelines by their operators.
 *
 * gpu_pipeline_hashmap owns a collection of GPUPipeline instances and builds
 * an unordered map from each GPUPhysicalOperator* (both intermediate operators
 * and the sink operator) to the GPUPipeline that contains it. This allows
 * efficient lookup of the pipeline associated with a given GPU physical
 * operator.
 *
 * The constructor expects a vector of pipelines that are already fully
 * constructed. During initialization, all operators from every pipeline are
 * inserted into the internal hashmap. If the same operator pointer is found
 * in more than one pipeline, a std::runtime_error is thrown, enforcing the
 * invariant that each operator belongs to at most one pipeline.
 *
 * Typical usage is to construct this class once for a set of pipelines and
 * then use the exposed _map and _vec members elsewhere to resolve
 * GPUPhysicalOperator instances back to their owning GPUPipeline.
