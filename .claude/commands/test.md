# Build and Run Tests

Build Sirius using pixi and run the tests the user selects.

## Steps

1. Build Sirius using pixi:
   ```
   pixi run make
   ```
   If build fails, diagnose and fix. If OOM, retry with `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=8 pixi run make`.

2. After a successful build, present the user with test options:

   ```
   Build succeeded. Which tests would you like to run?

   1. All SQL logic tests (make test)
   2. A specific SQL logic test file (provide path, e.g. test/sql/tpch-sirius.test)
   3. All C++ unit tests
   4. A specific C++ unit test (provide name or [tag])
   5. Auto-detect from changed files
   ```

   Wait for the user to choose before proceeding.

3. Run the selected tests using pixi:
   - **All SQL logic tests**: `pixi run make test`
   - **Specific SQL test**: `pixi run bash -c "build/release/test/unittest --test-dir . <test-file>"`
   - **All C++ unit tests**: `pixi run bash -c "build/release/extension/sirius/test/cpp/sirius_unittest"`
   - **Specific C++ unit test**: `pixi run bash -c "build/release/extension/sirius/test/cpp/sirius_unittest '<name-or-tag>'"`
   - **Auto-detect**: Check `git diff dev --name-only` to identify changed files, then run the most relevant tests. Explain the reasoning to the user before running.

4. If tests fail:
   - Show the failure output clearly.
   - Analyze the root cause.
   - Ask the user if they want you to fix it. If yes, apply the fix and re-run the failing test.

5. Report results: total passed, failed, and skipped.
