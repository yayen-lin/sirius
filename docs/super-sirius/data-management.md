# Data Management

This document covers data batches, data repositories, ports, barrier semantics, and data format conversion.

## Data Batch Lifecycle

A data batch flows through the system in these stages:

```
1. Scan Phase:     scan_task creates data_batch with host/parquet representation
2. Repository:     batch is stored in shared_data_repository
3. Consumption:    task_creator pops batch, transitions to task_created state
4. Execution:      GPU task locks batch, converts to GPU, executes operator chain
5. Output:         operators produce new batches, pushed to downstream repositories
6. Downgrade:      if GPU memory pressure, batch moved to host (optional)
7. Cleanup:        batch destroyed when no longer referenced
```

### Batch State Machine

Each `data_batch` (from cuCascade) maintains a state:

```
idle → task_created → processing → idle
                   ↘ in_transit (downgrade) → idle
```

- **idle**: available for consumption or downgrade
- **task_created**: claimed by task creator, not yet executing
- **processing**: locked by a GPU task during execution
- **in_transit**: locked by downgrade executor during tier migration

## Data Repositories

Data repositories are thread-safe containers managed by the `shared_data_repository_manager`:

- Keyed by `(operator_id, port_id)` pairs
- Support partitioned storage (multiple partitions per repository)
- Provide `add_data_batch()` for producers and `pop_data_batch()` for consumers
- Track total size and per-partition sizes
- Registered centrally in `shared_data_repository_manager` for downgrade candidate selection

### `shared_data_repository_manager`

Central registry of all repositories in query execution:
- Provides `for_each_repository()` iterator for downgrade candidate selection
- Thread-safe access to all active repositories

## Port System

**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_operator.hpp`

Ports connect pipelines by routing data from one operator's output to another's input:

```cpp
struct port {
    MemoryBarrierType type;                    // PIPELINE, PARTIAL, or FULL
    cucascade::shared_data_repository* repo;   // holds queued data_batch objects
    shared_ptr<sirius_pipeline> src_pipeline;  // pipeline producing data
    shared_ptr<sirius_pipeline> dest_pipeline; // pipeline consuming data
};
```

### Barrier Semantics

| Barrier | Behavior | When Used |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| `FULL` | Downstream waits until upstream pipeline is **completely finished** before consuming any data | Hash join build side — entire hash table must be built before probing |
| `PARTIAL` | Downstream can consume data **incrementally** as it arrives, but respects pipeline boundaries | CONCAT after PARTITION in streaming joins (INNER) |
| `PIPELINE` | No synchronization — data flows **immediately** | Within a single pipeline |

### `push_data_batch()`

When a sink's `sink()` method produces output batches, the default implementation pushes each batch to downstream operators:

```cpp
for (auto& batch : output_batches) {
    for (auto& [next_op, port_id] : next_port_after_sink) {
        next_op->push_data_batch(port_id, batch);
    }
}
```

`next_port_after_sink` is configured during pipeline construction by `insert_repository()`.

### Port Names

Operators access their ports by string name:
- `"default"` — primary input (most operators)
- `"build"` — build-side input (hash join only)

## Operator Data Containers

### `operator_data`

Minimal empty base class. Provides a generic extension point for any type of operator data — signaling objects, metadata-only data, or non-batch representations can derive from `operator_data` without being forced into the batch model.

### `pipelineable_operator_data`

Extends `operator_data` with batch-based data flow (previously this logic lived directly in `operator_data`):
- `std::vector<shared_ptr<data_batch>>` — the batch vector
- `get_data_batches()` / `release_data_batches()` — access and ownership transfer
- `prepare_for_processing()` — virtual hook for pre-execution preparation
- Created by `get_next_task_input_data()` from port pops
- Passed through the operator chain during `execute()`

### `partitioned_operator_data`

Extends `pipelineable_operator_data` with a partition index (`get_partition_idx()`). Used by partition-aware operators (CONCAT, MERGE_SORT, MERGE_GROUP_BY) to track which partition the data belongs to.

### Class Hierarchy

```
operator_data                       (empty generic base)
  └── pipelineable_operator_data    (batch vector + data flow methods)
       └── partitioned_operator_data (adds partition_idx)
```

## Data Format Conversion

### `sirius_converter_registry`

**File:** `src/include/data/sirius_converter_registry.hpp`

Global singleton for converting between data representations:
- Registers builtin cuCascade converters + Sirius-specific converters (parquet)
- Thread-safe initialization via mutex
- Used by:
  - Downgrade tasks: GPU representation → HOST representation
  - Scan tasks: Parquet representation → GPU table representation
  - GPU pipeline tasks: HOST representation → GPU representation (`lock_or_prepare_batch`)

### Conversion Examples

| From | To | When |
|------|----|------|
| `host_data_representation` | GPU `cudf::table` | GPU task input preparation |
| GPU `cudf::table` | `host_data_representation` | Downgrade executor |
| `host_parquet_representation` | GPU `cudf::table` | Parquet materialization |
