# Super Sirius Documentation

Super Sirius is the new task-based GPU execution engine in Sirius, invoked via `CALL gpu_execution('SELECT ...')`. It uses `namespace sirius` and replaces the legacy `gpu_processing` path with a pipelined, multi-threaded architecture that partitions work across GPU and CPU thread pools.

## How It Differs from Legacy Sirius

| Aspect | Legacy (`gpu_processing`) | Super Sirius (`gpu_execution`) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Namespace | `duckdb` | `sirius` |
| Entry point | `CALL gpu_processing(...)` | `CALL gpu_execution(...)` |
| Plan generator | `GPUPhysicalPlanGenerator` | `sirius_physical_plan_generator` |
| Operators | `GPUPhysicalOperator` in `src/operator/` | `sirius_physical_operator` in `src/op/` |
| Execution model | Single-threaded GPU executor | Multi-pipeline task-based execution |
| Memory management | `GPUBufferManager` | cuCascade tiered memory (GPU/Host/Disk) |
