# Operators

This document covers all Super Sirius physical operators, organized by category.

## Base Class

**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_operator.hpp`

`sirius_physical_operator` is the base class for every operator.

### Pipeline Model

After pipeline finalization (see [Physical Plan Generation — Pipeline Finalization](physical-plan-generation.md#pipeline-finalization)), a pipeline's `operators` list contains **all** operators from first to last. `source` and `sink` are aliases:
- `source` = `operators[0]` (first operator)
- `sink` = last operator in the list

During task execution:
1. `compute_task()` iterates over **every** operator in `operators`, calling `execute()` on each
2. `publish_output()` then calls `sink()` on the last operator to push results to downstream ports

An operator's position in a pipeline is determined by `sirius_engine::initialize_internal()`. Many blocking operators appear as both the source (first) of one pipeline and the sink (last) of another — they accumulate data as a sink, then emit results as a source. See the [Operator Summary Table](#operator-summary-table) for the full per-operator breakdown.

### Key Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `execute(input_data, stream)` | Called on **every** operator during `compute_task()` |
| `sink(output_data, stream)` | Called on the **last** operator after `compute_task()` to push results downstream |
| `is_source()` | Whether this operator can produce data (has scan state or owns accumulated data) |
| `is_sink()` | Whether this operator has a `sink()` implementation for pushing data to downstream ports |
| `get_next_task_hint()` | Checks port readiness, returns `READY` or `WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA` |
| `get_next_task_input_data()` | Pops one data batch from each input port |
| `can_create_more_tasks()` / `has_processed_all_tasks()` | Signals task exhaustion |

See [Task Creator](task-creator.md) for per-operator overrides.

## Scan Operators

These operators produce data for pipelines. See [Scan](scan.md) for in-depth coverage.

### `sirius_physical_table_scan` — `TABLE_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_table_scan.hpp`

Base scan operator wrapping a DuckDB table function. Stores column IDs, projection IDs, and optional table filters for predicate pushdown. During pipeline construction, converted to either DUCKDB_SCAN or PARQUET_SCAN.

### `sirius_physical_duckdb_scan` — `DUCKDB_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_duckdb_scan.hpp`

Sequential scan using DuckDB's execution engine. Accumulates chunks into fixed-size batches via column builders. Tracks an atomic `exhausted` flag for pipeline completion.

### `sirius_physical_parquet_scan` — `PARQUET_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_parquet_scan.hpp`

Direct Parquet file scan. Reads column-chunk byte ranges and optionally materializes (decompresses) to table format. Tracks `has_more_partitions` atomic flag. Row groups are partitioned by `approximate_batch_size`.

### `sirius_physical_iceberg_scan` — `ICEBERG_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_iceberg_scan.hpp`

Apache Iceberg table scan with GPU-accelerated delete filters. Inherits from `sirius_physical_parquet_scan` since Iceberg uses Parquet as the data layer. Supports Iceberg V1 (append-only) and V2 (positional and equality deletes).

- **Delete filter pipeline:** Composes `positional_delete_filter` (sorted row position binary search) and `equality_delete_filter` (GPU `cudf::distinct_hash_join` anti-join mask) to apply deletes entirely on GPU with no D2H copies
- **Metadata:** Custom `iceberg_metadata_reader` with lightweight Avro parser for manifest-list and manifest files
- **Key members:** `positional_delete_files`, `equality_delete_files`

See [Scan — Iceberg Scan](scan.md#iceberg-scan) for details.

### `sirius_parquet_metadata_scan_operator` — `PARQUET_METADATA_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/scan/sirius_parquet_metadata_scan_operator.hpp`

First pipeline operator in the two-pipeline Parquet scan architecture. Parses Parquet footers for up to 8 files per task, attempts cuDF AST filter translation, and emits `partitioned_parquet_metadata` containing reader options, file metadata, and row-group partitions. See [Scan — Two-Pipeline Metadata Scan](scan.md#two-pipeline-metadata-scan).

### `sirius_gpu_parquet_scan_operator` — `GPU_PARQUET_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/scan/sirius_gpu_parquet_scan_operator.hpp`

Second pipeline operator in the two-pipeline Parquet scan architecture. Acts as sink of Pipeline 1 (accumulating metadata from `PARQUET_METADATA_SCAN`) and source of Pipeline 2 (serving `parquet_scan_data` tasks that call `cudf::io::read_parquet`). See [Scan — Two-Pipeline Metadata Scan](scan.md#two-pipeline-metadata-scan).

### `sirius_physical_dummy_scan` — `DUMMY_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_dummy_scan.hpp`

Generates a single empty row for constant queries (e.g., `SELECT 1+2`).

### `sirius_physical_column_data_scan` — `COLUMN_DATA_SCAN` / `CTE_SCAN` / `DELIM_SCAN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_column_data_scan.hpp`

Scans a pre-materialized `ColumnDataCollection`. Used for CTE results, correlated subquery intermediates, and expression-generated data.

## Streaming Operators

These operators process data in a single pass without buffering.

### `sirius_physical_filter` — `FILTER`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_filter.hpp`

Applies a predicate expression to filter rows.

- **GPU execution:** `GpuExpressionExecutor::select(batch, stream)` — evaluates the boolean expression and compacts rows using cuDF filtering
- **Key members:** `expression` (filter predicate)

### `sirius_physical_projection` — `PROJECTION`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_projection.hpp`

Evaluates a list of expressions to produce output columns.

- **GPU execution:** `GpuExpressionExecutor::execute(batch, stream)` — evaluates each expression, producing a new table with projected columns
- **Key members:** `select_list` (output expressions)

### `sirius_physical_streaming_limit` — `STREAMING_LIMIT`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_limit.hpp`

Implements LIMIT/OFFSET using atomic counters for parallel execution.

- **Key members:** `_remaining_offset` (atomic), `_remaining_limit` (atomic), `_limit_exhausted` (atomic)
- **Mechanism:** Each task atomically claims a portion of the remaining limit via `claim()`. When the limit is exhausted, the pipeline terminates early.

## Blocking Operators

These operators buffer input before producing output. They are both sinks and sources.

### `sirius_physical_hash_join` — `HASH_JOIN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_hash_join.hpp`, `src/op/sirius_physical_hash_join.cpp`

Three execution modes:

| Mode | When Used | cuDF API |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `STANDARD` | Default, multi-partition Cartesian product | `cudf::inner_join()`, `cudf::left_join()`, etc. |
| `BUILD_PROBE` | Small build side (< `max_build_hash_table_bytes`, 1 partition) | `cudf::hash_join` or `cudf::distinct_hash_join` (build once, probe many) |
| `MIXED_JOIN` | Equality + inequality conditions on disjoint columns | `cudf::mixed_join()` with cuDF AST |

#### Distinct Hash Join Optimization
In BUILD_PROBE mode, when the build-side keys are proven unique, Sirius uses `cudf::distinct_hash_join` instead of `cudf::hash_join`. This optimization applies when:
- Join type is INNER or LEFT
- Build-side keys are proven unique via logical plan analysis (`prove_unique_columns()` in `src/planner/sirius_plan_comparison_join.cpp`)

Uniqueness is detected by walking the DuckDB logical plan:
- **PRIMARY KEY** on `LogicalGet` (with column mapping through `projection_ids`)
- **GROUP BY** uniqueness on `LogicalAggregate`
- Propagates through `LogicalFilter`, `LogicalOrder`, `LogicalLimit`, `LogicalTopN`, and `LogicalProjection`

Only PRIMARY KEY is considered (not plain UNIQUE) due to NULL handling semantics with `null_equality::UNEQUAL`. IS NOT DISTINCT FROM joins are excluded since they require `null_equality::EQUAL`.

Build/probe state machine for BUILD_PROBE mode:
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    NOT_BUILT --> SCHEDULING
    SCHEDULING --> SCHEDULED
    SCHEDULED --> BUILT
    BUILT --> DESTROYED
```

When `get_next_task_hint()` is called after the operator is already finished, it returns `std::nullopt` (no new tasks needed).

Key members:
- `conditions` — join predicates (equality and inequality)
- `join_type` — INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER
- `_hash_table` — cached `cudf::hash_join` or `cudf::distinct_hash_join` (BUILD_PROBE mode)
- `_build_table` — materialized build-side data batch
- `key_casts` — type alignment info for hash key matching
- `unique_build_keys` / `unique_probe_keys` — cardinality hints (used to select distinct vs standard hash join)

Supported join types: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER via `cudf::inner_join()`, `cudf::left_join()`, `cudf::full_outer_join()`.

### `sirius_physical_nested_loop_join` — `NESTED_LOOP_JOIN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_nested_loop_join.hpp`

Fallback for joins not supported by cuDF hash join (pure inequality conditions). Uses `PhysicalNestedLoopJoin::IsSupported()` to validate.

### `sirius_physical_order` — `ORDER_BY`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_order.hpp`

Local sort of each data batch.

- **GPU execution:** `gpu_order_impl::local_order_by()` using `cudf::order_by()`
- **Key members:** `orders` (sort keys with ASC/DESC and null ordering), `projections` (output columns), `is_index_sort`

### `sirius_physical_top_n` — `TOP_N`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_top_n.hpp`

Combined ORDER + LIMIT: selects and sorts the top N rows.

- **GPU execution:** Two-step process: `cudf::top_k_order()` selects top-N row indices, then `cudf::sort_by_key()` sorts the gathered rows to ensure deterministic output ordering- **Key members:** `orders`, `limit`, `offset`, `dynamic_filter`

### `sirius_physical_ungrouped_aggregate` — `UNGROUPED_AGGREGATE`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_ungrouped_aggregate.hpp`

Aggregate without GROUP BY (e.g., `SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(x) FROM t`).

- **GPU execution:** `gpu_aggregate_impl::local_ungrouped_aggregate()` using `cudf::reduce()`
- **Supported:** MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT_ALL, COUNT_VALID
- **DECIMAL overflow handling:** DECIMAL SUM casts to a wider type before reduction — DECIMAL32→DECIMAL64, DECIMAL64→DECIMAL128 — to prevent overflow
- **BIGINT SUM fallback:** BIGINT (INT64) SUM falls back to CPU execution because GPU lacks INT128 accumulator support. Without this, silent overflow produces incorrect results. BIGINT arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL) also fall back to CPU for the same reason.

### `sirius_physical_grouped_aggregate` — `HASH_GROUP_BY`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_grouped_aggregate.hpp`

Hash-based GROUP BY.

- **GPU execution:** `gpu_aggregate_impl::local_grouped_aggregate()` using `cudf::groupby()`
- **AVG handling:** Decomposed into SUM + COUNT_VALID via `AggregateSlot`
- **COUNT(DISTINCT):** Implemented via `COLLECT_SET` aggregation with struct column synthesis
- **Key members:** `group_idx`, `cudf_aggregates`, `cudf_aggregate_idx`, `aggregate_slots`, `has_avg`, `has_count_distinct`

## Pipeline Breakers (Sirius-Specific)

These operators are injected during pipeline splitting. They don't map to DuckDB logical operators.

### `sirius_physical_partition` — `PARTITION`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_partition.hpp`

Repartitions data into N buckets based on partition keys.

- **Modes:** `HASH` (most common), `RANGE`, `EVENLY`, `CUSTOM`, `NONE`
- **Adaptive count:** `determine_num_partitions()` computes N from actual input data size and `hash_partition_bytes` config
- **Sibling coordination:** Build-side partition determines count; probe-side waits for the result
- **Key members:** `_partition_keys`, `_partition_type`, `_num_partitions`, `_is_build`, `_sibling_partition_op`

### `sirius_physical_concat` — `CONCAT`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_concat.hpp`

Reassembles partitioned data back into a linear stream. Behavior depends on join type:

- `_concat_all = true` (LEFT/ANTI/OUTER joins): waits for all data before emitting
- `_concat_all = false` (INNER joins): emits tasks when byte threshold (`_concat_batch_bytes`) is met

### `sirius_physical_sort_sample` — `SORT_SAMPLE`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_sort_sample.hpp`

Samples N input batches to compute P-1 partition boundary rows for range partitioning.

- On first execution: concatenate samples, sort, compute boundaries, set `_boundaries_computed`
- On subsequent executions: pass through data unchanged
- Custom `get_next_task_hint()`: waits for N batches before returning READY

### `sirius_physical_sort_partition` — `SORT_PARTITION`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_sort_partition.hpp`

Range-partitions data according to boundaries computed by SORT_SAMPLE. Links to the sample operator via `_sample_op`.

### `sirius_physical_merge_sort` — `MERGE_SORT`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_merge_sort.hpp`

Merges pre-sorted partitions using `gpu_merge_impl::merge_order_by()` (multi-way merge via cuDF).

- Custom `get_next_task_input_data()`: drains all batches from one partition per call
- Tracks `_current_partition_index` atomically under mutex

### `sirius_physical_grouped_aggregate_merge` — `MERGE_GROUP_BY`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_grouped_aggregate_merge.hpp`

Merges grouped aggregate results from multiple partitions. Drains one partition per task, similar to MERGE_SORT.

### `sirius_physical_ungrouped_aggregate_merge` — `MERGE_AGGREGATE`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_ungrouped_aggregate_merge.hpp`

Merges ungrouped aggregate results from multiple partitions.

### `sirius_physical_top_n_merge` — `MERGE_TOP_N`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_top_n_merge.hpp`

Merges local top-N results from multiple partitions.

## CTE / Delim Join Operators

### `sirius_physical_cte` — `CTE`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_cte.hpp`

Materializes Common Table Expression results into a `ColumnDataCollection` for later scanning by CTE_SCAN operators.

- **Key members:** `working_table`, `cte_scans`, `ctename`, `table_index`

### `sirius_physical_left_delim_join` — `LEFT_DELIM_JOIN`
### `sirius_physical_right_delim_join` — `RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_delim_join.hpp`

Handle correlated subqueries via duplicate elimination. Wrap an inner join (hash or nested loop) and embed a `sirius_physical_grouped_aggregate` for DISTINCT on duplicate-eliminated columns.

- `join` — the actual join operator
- `distinct` — embedded aggregate for duplicate elimination
- `delim_scans` — downstream scan operators that receive the deduplicated data

### `sirius_physical_partition_consumer_operator`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_partition_consumer_operator.hpp`

Base interface for operators that consume partitioned data. Provides `push_data_batch_partitioned(port_id, batch, partition_idx)`.

## Result Operators

### `sirius_physical_result_collector` / `sirius_physical_materialized_collector` — `RESULT_COLLECTOR`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_result_collector.hpp`

Final sink that materializes query results into a `ColumnDataCollection`. The GPU executor checks for this operator type to determine query completion.

### `sirius_physical_empty_result` — `EMPTY_RESULT`
**File:** `src/include/op/sirius_physical_empty_result.hpp`

Returns an empty result set for queries with contradicted filters.

## Operator Summary Table

After pipeline finalization, `source` and `sink` are just aliases for the first and last operator in the `operators` list. All operators have `execute()` called during `compute_task()`; only the last operator additionally has `sink()` called via `publish_output()`.
